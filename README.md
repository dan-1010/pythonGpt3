# pythonGpt3Tutorial
The program is an example of using the OpenAI GPT-3 model to generate text based on a given prompt. To use the program, you will need to have an OpenAI API key, which you can obtain by creating an account on the OpenAI website.

The program first imports the openai module, which is the Python library that allows you to interact with the OpenAI API. Next, the open_file() function is defined. This function takes a file path as an input, opens the file at that path, and returns the contents of the file as a string. This is used to read the OpenAI API key from a file on your computer.

Next, the API key is read from the file using the open_file() function, and it is assigned to the openai.api_key attribute. This is necessary for the openai library to be able to access the OpenAI API using your API key.

The gpt3_completion() function is then defined. This function takes a prompt string as an input, and it uses the OpenAI API to generate text based on the prompt. The function has several optional arguments that allow you to customize the behavior of the GPT-3 model, such as the temperature, the maximum number of tokens, and the frequency and presence penalties.

Finally, the main body of the program is executed. This calls the gpt3_completion() function with a sample prompt, and it prints the generated text to the console. Here is the complete code:
